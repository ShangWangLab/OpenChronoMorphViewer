"""Main function file for the Open Chrono-Morph Viewer application.

This was originally developed to load large 3D volumes captured using an
OCT microscope and manage them in memory to play volumetric video with
Doppler as quickly as possible.

Developed for Python version 3.11.4

Required 3rd party packages:
* NumPy 1.25.2 - for 3D data operations
* psutil 5.9.5 - for getting the current RAM usage
* PyNRRD 1.0.0 (Nearly Raw Raster Data) - for the image file format
* PyQt5 5.15.2.2.3 - for the user interface
* PyVTK 9.2.6 - for volumetric rendering
* SciPy 1.11.1 - for the "cdist" function
* tifffile 2023.7.18 - for reading 3D TIFF files

Required 3rd party software:
* FFmpeg 6.1.1 (and added to PATH) - for compiling animation videos

Tested on:
* Window 10 and 11
* macOS 13.0 (experienced issues on 12.6.0)
* Ubuntu 20.04
